# Stomp
Split, staggered column 40% keyboard. Designed in KiCad with symbols and footprints from [keyboard-parts](https://github.com/mvmorin/keyboard-parts) library.

# Features
* Low profile and flat-bottom design to be put on top of laptop keyboards.
* Extra large stagger for pinky columns.
* Based on a standard 40% 4x12 layout but only contains the reachable keys. It should be compatible with most 40% 4x12 layouts.
* Only a single Teensy or Pro-Micro-compatible controller board needed.
* Full FR4 (PCB) design, including backplate, for easy single order manufacturing.
* Both MX and Alps plates.

# PCB and Plate files
The production files for the latest version can be found in the 'gerber' directory. They have been test printed at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/). Any notes from the test prints can be found below.

## Test Print Comments
The mounting pin holes for 5-pin MX-switches are bit tighter than I would have preferred. They are perfectly usable with the Ink Blacks I tested them but they will be enlarged in any potential future revisions.
